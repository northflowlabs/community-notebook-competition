# The EOPF Zarr Community Notebook Competition

Welcome to the [EOPF Zarr Community Notebook Competition](https://thrivegeo.com/eopf-community-notebook-competition/)! We're inviting Sentinel data users and developers to create and submit their own innovative Jupyter Notebooks. The goal? To showcase the power of cloud-native workflows using the EOPF Zarr Sample Service and its accompanying plugins.

This competition is a great opportunity to expand your skills, contribute to the Earth observation community, and win prizes. Whether you're a seasoned expert or just starting your journey into cloud-native data, this competition is for you. We'll provide all the resources you need to get started, including the [EOPF 101 book](https://eopf-toolkit.github.io/eopf-101/), which is packed with case studies, example notebooks, and documentation.

## How to Participate
The competition is structured in five stages, designed to guide you from learning to submission and, finally, to an awards showcase.

### Stage 1: Launch & Registration
The competition officially begins with its launch at Big Data in Space on 30 September 2025. During this stage, you'll be able to [register your interest](https://thrivegeo.com/eopf-toolkit-competition/) to receive updates!

We'll also host an [introductory webinar on 16 October 2025](https://buytickets.at/thrivegeo/1879939) to help you get acquainted with the EOPF Sample Service ecosystem and the resources available to you. Sign-up now! 

### Stage 2: Learning & Development
This is where you'll dive deep into the [EOPF 101 book](https://eopf-toolkit.github.io/eopf-101/) and start building your notebook. We'll provide support through our [Discourse forum](https://discourse.eopf.copernicus.eu/t/eopf-zarr-activities-at-big-data-from-space/475), live Q&A sessions, and guided co-working sessions. 

The [EOPF Sentinel Zarr Sample Service JupyterLab](https://jupyterhub.user.eopf.eodc.eu/hub) will be your primary development environment.

Once you access with your [CDSE](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) credentials, you will get the chance to choose the language you want to develop with! If you are not yet registered, you can do it [here](https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/login-actions/registration?client_id=account-console&tab_id=B4WzkvfBZbA).

When starting your server, you will be able to select the **Docker image** you want to work with. The EOPF Toolkit has designed updated environments to support your development!<br>

You can select: **Specify an existing docker image**.

Once you click, the following box is displayed:

<p align="center"><img title="Define the docker option" alt="Alt text" src="/img/def_di.png" class="center" ></p>

In the box, you can copy and paste the following custom lines:
* If you would like to develop your workflow in Python:<br>
`4zm3809f.c1.de1.container-registry.ovh.net/eopf-toolkit-python/eopf-toolkit-python:competition`

* Or, if you prefer to use R:<br>
`4zm3809f.c1.de1.container-registry.ovh.net/eopf-toolkit-r/eopf-toolkit-r:competition`

And select **Start**.

You will be redirected to your development space in the JupyterLab!<br>

To get some ideas on how to get started with your development, watch the introductory session [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7_C3rxjjp4).

### Stage 3: Notebook Submission
Submit your completed Jupyter Notebook via GitHub once complete, between 1 November 2025 and 15 March 2026 (23:59 UTC+1).

You will need to fill in a Submission Form (in a Markdown file), and follow [these instructions](https://github.com/eopf-toolkit/community-notebook-competition/tree/main/submissions). 

For a step-by-step on how to submit your work, you can follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z37fNmIUeAg). Here we guide you through the submission in GitHub!

### Stage 4: Judging & Evaluation
A panel of expert judges will evaluate each submission based on technical soundness, effective use of the **EOPF Zarr** data and plugins and educational quality.

### Stage 5: Awards & Showcase
The competition culminates in an online award showcase where **winners** and **highly commended entries** will be announced. 

The top notebooks will be featured in the EOPF 101 book as new case studies and you will be given the chance to be a co-author of a publication on EOPF-101. 

There is also a prize pool of 10 000 Euros in upskilling vouchers sponsored by [thriveGEO](https://www.thrivegeo.com). In addition, there will be exciting ESA swag such as Sentinel-2 Lego sets up for grabs!
